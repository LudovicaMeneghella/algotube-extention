		<p><span id="first" class="yellow">AlgoTube is a Youtube extension.</span><br>
			<br>
			Youtube replaced television quickly. It was meant to be a online archive for video created from users for users, and it works with the same goal of other mass media: giving all users the same contents. Although its success was due to its possibility to choose, we turned to be passive users, following only the possibilities that the algorithm shows us. AlgoTube shows the algorithm, modifyng the interface, not the mechanism itself.<br>
			<br>
			At first the user is active: he starts its experience searching a video without any distractions or suggestions. After that the algorithm reveals itself: the interface allows the user to play just one video, the first one chosen because of the number of visualizations. In order to enphasize this criteria, the number of the visualization next to the video is highlighted. This numbers can determinate visibility or oblivion, the more the they are high, the more they will grow. This logic is not so simple, but it is going to be revealed. Now the user is forced to be passive, since he can play only the first choice of Youtube&#39;s algorithm. He is bound to it. Now that he is bound to it, he can only get caught up see where this is going to take him.<br>
